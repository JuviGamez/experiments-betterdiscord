# Experiments Plugin
Enable Access to Experiments &amp; other dev-only features in Discord! Ported from Vencord to BetterDiscord!

# How It Works
This plugin is built from scratch, cause porting it from TypeScript to JavaScript was not an option.Back to the point i found this [article](https://emoji.gg/blog/how-to-enable-experiments-in-discord#:~:text=To%20access%20Discord%20Experiments%2C%20users,and%20try%20out%20new%20features.) that shows how you can paste this piece of code into the console and enable experiments, I doubted it at first as a way to get my token(but i have watched to much ntts) so i checked the code and it was not suspisous and worked! So I made a plugin which just pastes this code into the console on start and thats it
